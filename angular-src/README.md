# Food App

# Background
Hoping to show people that size matters in terms of how much you eat, this app provides tables/visualizations that detail various types of fruits, vegtables and snacks and:
1. How many oz you get out of a portion of a particular food item
2. How much cost and calories vary per portion of food


## Technical Details
Front-end
1. Angular 2
2. Charts.js
3. Bootstrap

Backend
1. MongoDB
2. Node
3. Express


## MVP
1. Use MongoDB database for storing all data related to fruit, vegetable, and snacks
2. Use route for navigation
3. Table displaying all information pulled from database
4. Visualizations to complement table (currently data hardcoded)
